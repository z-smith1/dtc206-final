        <h2>Digital Inclusion and the Role of Libraries</h2>
        <p>In our Digital Inclusion course, we have discussed how the internet and technology are essential for everyday life. However, not everyone has equal access to these resources. Public and college libraries help close this gap by providing free access to computers, the internet, and training programs.
            During Week 3, we learned about the role libraries played when many were closed during the pandemic, showing just how important they are to people who need these resources. For my project, I will explore how libraries contribute to digital inclusion, 
            especially by offering technology access and teaching digital skills. I will also look into the challenges libraries face, such as limited funding and outdated technology. 
            My research will highlight why libraries are crucial for digital inclusion and the issues they must overcome to support their communities.</p>

        <h2>Challenges Faced by Libraries</h2>
        <p>Public and college libraries face various challenges in promoting digital inclusion. Some of the key barriers include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of adequate funding to provide technology and internet access</li>
            <li>Increased demand for digital literacy training programs</li>
            <li>Infrastructure limitations, especially in rural or underfunded areas</li>
            <li>Privacy and security concerns with internet usage and data management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Addressing these challenges is essential to ensuring equitable access to digital resources for all members of society.</p>

        <h2>Library Resources for Digital Inclusion</h2>
        <p>Libraries can offer a wide range of resources to support digital inclusion, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Free internet access for library patrons</li>
            <li>Digital literacy workshops and training sessions</li>
            <li>Public computer terminals for those without access at home</li>
            <li>Support for research and homework through online databases and digital archives</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At WSU and the Pullman Public Library, resources such as public computers and study rooms with internet access provide students with the tools needed to succeed in their academic and personal endeavors.</p>
