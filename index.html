        <h2>Research Question</h2>
        <p>In this project, I explore how public and college libraries contribute to digital inclusion and the challenges they face in providing access to technology and digital literacy resources. Libraries are key players in bridging the digital divide, providing critical resources to communities and students who may lack access to technology at home.</p>
        <p>This research aligns with themes in our Digital Inclusion class, particularly the role of libraries during the COVID-19 pandemic, where many students were impacted by the closure of public libraries.</p>

        <h2>Challenges Faced by Libraries</h2>
        <p>Public and college libraries face various challenges in promoting digital inclusion. Some of the key barriers include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of adequate funding to provide technology and internet access</li>
            <li>Increased demand for digital literacy training programs</li>
            <li>Infrastructure limitations, especially in rural or underfunded areas</li>
            <li>Privacy and security concerns with internet usage and data management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Addressing these challenges is essential to ensuring equitable access to digital resources for all members of society.</p>

        <h2>Library Resources for Digital Inclusion</h2>
        <p>Libraries offer a wide range of resources to support digital inclusion, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Free internet access for library patrons</li>
            <li>Digital literacy workshops and training sessions</li>
            <li>Public computer terminals for those without access at home</li>
            <li>Support for research and homework through online databases and digital archives</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At Washington State University and the Pullman Public Library, resources such as loanable laptops and study rooms with internet access provide students with the tools needed to succeed in their academic and personal endeavors.</p>
